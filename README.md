# Shared_Task_Information_Science
The PreTENS shared task hosted at SemEval 2022 aims at focusing on semantic competence with specific attention on the evaluation of language models with respect to the recognition of appropriate taxonomic relations between two nominal arguments (i.e. cases where one is a supercategory of the other, or in extensional terms, one denotes a superset of the other).
