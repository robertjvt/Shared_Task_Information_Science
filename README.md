# Shared_Task_Information_Science
The PreTENS shared task hosted at SemEval 2022 aims at focusing on semantic competence with specific attention on the evaluation of language models with respect to the recognition of appropriate taxonomic relations between two nominal arguments (i.e. cases where one is a supercategory of the other, or in extensional terms, one denotes a superset of the other).

<h2>To do:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Add description of the script at the top and name of who made it</li>
  <li>Add comments to each script</li>
  <li>Make a file (or set of files) with all upsampled data</li>
  <li>Make a detailed overview of the difference between the original data and the upsampled data</li>
  <li>Add results in a txt file in the results folder! Also add the settings you used to create these results</li>
  <li>Remove redundant files. Only keep the files that currently serve a purpose or are important for reproducibility</li>
</ul>
